    <!-- Author of the story -->
    <h4>By Prudence Minayo</h4>
    <p>The group is made up of three members. Mordecai Mwinyi who is the lead singer, Wachira Gatama who is the poet and Kenneth Muya, the guitarist.Their lyrical content, delivery and stage presence is what should define Kenyan music. Those who have attended H_art the Band shows will agree with this writer that Kenya overflows with talent. The trio style is refreshingly unique and so is their dress code.git</p>
